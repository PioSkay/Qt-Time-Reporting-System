The aim of the project was to construct a simple reporting system for the time spent on a given project. The tools I used were the Qt framework and the C++ language. Data was saved via JSON files. After launching an application you are welcome by the logging/register screen:

After the authentication process, the main login screen appears which is the control panel of the user. From here you are capable of picking viewing time logged on a particular day. You can review other people's reports in your projects. And finally, you can submit and request the status of particular months.
